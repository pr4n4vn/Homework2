## Task 1 - Basic Vector Practice
```{r}
#1
pre_bp <- c(130, 128, 116, 124, 133, 134, 118, 126, 114, 127, 141, 138, 128, 140, 137, 131, 120, 128, 139, 135)

post_bp <- c(114, 98, 113, 99, 107, 116, 113, 111, 119, 117, 101, 119, 130, 122, 106, 106, 124, 102, 117, 113)

#2
names(pre_bp) <- paste("Subject", 1:20, sep = "_")
names(post_bp)<- paste("Subject", 1:20, sep = "_")
pre_bp
post_bp

#3
diffbp <- c(pre_bp[1:20] - post_bp[1:20])
diffbp

#4
mean(diffbp)

#5
which(diffbp > 0)

#6
diffbp[diffbp > 0]

#7
mean(diffbp > 0)

```

## Task 2: Basic Data Frame practice

```{r}
#1
  data.frame(patient = 1:20, pre_bp, post_bp, diffbp)
```
